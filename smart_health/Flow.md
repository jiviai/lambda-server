### Detailed Explanation of the Workflow

1. **Start**
   - **Event**: The workflow begins with a trigger event.
   - **Explanation**: This may be a user action, scheduled job, or any system event that generates an entry in the DynamoDB table.

2. **Event Triggered (DynamoDB Entry)**
   - **Event**: New data entry is added to DynamoDB.
   - **Explanation**: AWS DynamoDB detects the new entry and triggers an AWS Lambda function to process this data.

3. **AWS Lambda Function Triggered**
   - **Function**: A Lambda function is automatically invoked.
   - **Explanation**: The Lambda function is set up to trigger based on the DynamoDB event. It retrieves the new entry for further processing.

4. **Flatten Data in Lambda**
   - **Process**: Data flattening and normalization.
   - **Explanation**: The Lambda function processes the DynamoDB entry. It extracts necessary fields, normalizes the structure, and flattens the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for insertion into PostgreSQL.

5. **Insert Flattened Data into PostgreSQL Ledger Table**
   - **Process**: Data insertion into PostgreSQL.
   - **Explanation**: The processed and normalized data is then inserted into a ledger table in a PostgreSQL database. This table categorizes data based on types (weight, totalCalories, height) and sources (Health Connect, FITBIT).

6. **Perform Data Aggregation**
   - **Process**: Aggregation based on user_id.
   - **Explanation**: Once data is inserted into the ledger table, an aggregation process occurs. This involves running queries or operations to aggregate the data by user_id, calculating sums, averages, or other necessary metrics.

7. **Insert Aggregated Data into Second Table**
   - **Process**: Insert aggregated data.
   - **Explanation**: The aggregated results are then inserted into a secondary table in the PostgreSQL database. This table is structured to organize aggregated data based on user_id.

8. **End**
   - **Event**: The workflow process completes.
   - **Explanation**: After all data is processed and inserted, the workflow completes successfully.
